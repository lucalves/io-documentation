# Customizing your store's icons

## Introduction

[VTEX Styleguide](https://styleguide.vtex.com) has a [default iconography](https://styleguide.vtex.com/#/Icons) that is used in all VTEX IO store's components. Their implementation is imported via the [Store Icons](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-icons) app. 

Although these can satisfy your storeâ€™s needs, you may want to override and customize default icons according to your store's identity. If so, simply follow the steps below. 

## Step by step

1. In your `store-theme` code, create a new folder named `iconpacks/` within `styles/`. 
2. Inside `iconpacks/`, create the file `iconpack.svg`. 
3. Copy the content from VTEX'S default [iconpack.svg](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-icons/blob/master/styles/iconpacks/iconpack.svg?short_path=62ebf4b) and paste it in the `iconpack.svg` file. 

This is how your `styles/` folder structure should look like after you've accomplished that:

The `iconpack.svg` file will implement [SVG fragment identifiers](https://css-tricks.com/svg-fragment-identifiers-work/), allowing you to simply change the part of the code that declares the icon's `g` tag instead of customize itself. 

For instance, let's customize the cart icon (`hpa-cart`) changing only its `g` content:

After [linking](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/linking-an-app) your app, you should see the changes in the browser:

Check out each icon's ID by accessing the [Icon Pack list](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-icons/blob/cbbb1b82bfca247a811d146b1e2cafb642db1928/docs/ICONPACK.md). 

<div class="alert alert-warning">
If you've linked your code and haven't seen your changes, it may be because your <code>Styles builder</code> is not up-to-date with this functionality. Make sure your store has it installed at version <bold>1.8.1</bold> or higher.
