# Building a Carousel through lists and Slider Layout

## Introduction

There are block types in VTEX IO's Store Framework that instead of being responsible for rendering store components, such as the `shelf`, they **carry and provide data to their subsequent child blocks**.

These blocks are instances of a `list-context` interface called `lists`. They are exported by the `vtex.list-context` app.

Since **a Carousel is a slider with images displayed on it**, you can create one for your store using one of the available `list-context` instances together with a `slider-layout`, a generic layout block that enables you to create a Slider component out of a set of other blocks. 

See the instructions below for how it can be easily done!

## Step by step

1. Make sure your store is running `vtex.store@2.70.0` or higher.

2. Add the following **dependencies** to your theme's `manifest.json` file:

```json
"vtex.store-image": "0.x",
"vtex.slider-layout": "0.x"
```

3. Declare the `list-context.image-list` block and use the `slider-layout` as its only child. Each desired image should be forwarded to the `list-context.image-list` as an object with the following properties:

| Property      | Type                                                                                                                                | Description                                                | Default value |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `image`       | `String`                                                                                                                            | Link for the image                                         | N/A           |
| `mobileImage` | `String`                                                                                                                            | Link for the mobile image                                  | N/A           |
| `description` | `String`                                                                                                                            | The image's description                                    | N/A           |
| `link`        | [`Link`](https://github.com/vtex-apps/native-types/blob/f63aeeb8f6e62f4a9aaec052a8be34973be7389b/pages/contentSchemas.json#L52-L74) | Specifies the link the image will redirect to when clicked on | N/A           |

_For example:_

```json
"list-context.image-list#demo": {
    "child": ["slider-layout#demo-images"],
    "props": {
      "height": 650,
      "images": [
        {
          "image": "https://storecomponents.vteximg.com.br/files/banner-infocard2.png",
          "description": "something something"
        },
        {
          "image": "https://storecomponents.vteximg.com.br/assets/vtex.file-manager-graphql/images/Group%207%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)___c6b3ed853fb16a08b265753b50e0c57a.png",
          "description": "something something"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
```

<div class="alert alert-warning">  
Bear in mind that <strong>list blocks do not render anything in your store</strong>, they simply hold content that can be edited using the Site Editor and pass it down to their child blocks.
</div>

4. Now that you've specified which data (in this case, which images) will be displayed in your slider using a `list` block, you need to configure the [slider properties](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.slider-layout) themselves, meaning those of the `slider-layout`. 

_For example:_

```json
  "list-context.image-list#demo": {
    "child": ["slider-layout#demo-images"],
    "props": {
      "height": 650,
      "images": [
        {
          "image": "https://storecomponents.vteximg.com.br/files/banner-infocard2.png",
          "description": "something something"
        },
        {
          "image": "https://storecomponents.vteximg.com.br/assets/vtex.file-manager-graphql/images/Group%207%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)%20(1)___c6b3ed853fb16a08b265753b50e0c57a.png",
          "description": "something something"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "slider-layout#demo-images": {
    "props": {
      "itemsPerPage": {
        "desktop": 1,
        "tablet": 1,
        "phone": 1
      },
      "infinite": true
    }
  }
```

And there you go! You now have a fully functioning Carousel for your store.

_When inspecting the page youâ€™ll notice that the `carousel` block was not used to build the component._ 

Bear in mind that you are also able to edit data contained in `list-context.image-list` using the admin's Site Editor section:
